@a11ylint/core is a tool designed to test the compliance of web projects with the French accessibility guidelines, RGAA (R√©f√©rentiel G√©n√©ral d'Am√©lioration de l'Accessibilit√©).

## Motivation

This project was born from an idea by CROQUET Mickael, who wanted to implement a series of tests for the French RGAA accessibility rules. To our surprise, after extensive research, we could not find any suitable library addressing this need.  
As a result, we decided to create our own package to validate RGAA rules.
